<h1>How Physics Relates to Video-Games</h1>

<p> Physics simulations are used throughout video games and provides the user with a more realistic and immersive experience. Physics implementation has become even more prominent and important with the emergence of widespread VR technology, as it allows the user to interact with objects that are around them in a virtual world, which are key to providing a sense of immersion and realism.   
<br></br>
To make video games more realistic and therefore more appealing to consumers that want to feel immersed, they simulate constant forces acting on bodies within the area, such as the forces of inertia and air resistance. For instance, in a superhero game, as the character turns to the left their cape carries on moving to the righty, eventually ceasing movement, and remaining stationary. This demonstrates the simulated effects of both inertia, gravity, and air resistance, which all makes for a much more realistic experience.  
<br></br>
On the subject of realism, systems such as particle effects and full-body rigs for character models and inter-actable objects in the game add to the realism immensely. Particle effect systems cause realistic looking dust clouds to obstruct the direct displacement of light rays, causing some areas to be darker than others depending on the particle density. Having full-body rigs for the character models also allows individual limbs to bend and move independent of other parts of the rig, allowing animators to animate characters fluidly and realistically, allowing for more believable character interactions, damage effects and expressions.  
<br></br>
These physics systems work in tandem to create a game that is much more appealing to a casual audience that are looking to become immersed in a video game, as well as players that are aiming to use video games as a visual showpiece or a training tool. Being realistic and having realistic physics implementation helps the game to become more prominent in the mainstream media, as seeing screenshots and images of the game alone is usually enough to entice consumers to become more interested in the game and talk about it to others.  
<br></br>
In recent years, IT companies like NVIDIA and AMD have developed a new type of GPU with the ability to simulate ray-tracing. This technology allows games to simulate light rays and map out their path, which allows us to create realistic shadows as well as enhance global illumination and reflections. Concepts such as friction and particle movement are also used in game to simulate the movement of waves, as well as ripples when an object collides with a liquid’s surface. The implementation of this technology also allows for it to be studied in a test case scenario, allowing for more powerful and useful physics simulations to be produced in the future according to user feedback.  
<br></br>
Ragdoll physics are another method that games use to simulate damage and the effects of forces on objects. Ragdoll physics enable game developers to demonstrate how forces interact with objects in their environment when the two collide. It can also be used to simulate the flexing and bending of objects as a part of their model is hit with a force. An example of this technology in use is when a character falls over, as their model uses physics to determine what limbs bend and are affected by other forces more than others. This technology can be used to simulate how forces work on inanimate objects and humans, which is useful both in the context of education, for example in medical school learning about broken limbs or blunt trauma, or in the context of a science experiment in which scientists aim to probe what happens to a body after a certain amount of force is applied to it, for example in testing the effects of heightened pressure in a person’s surroundings.  
<br></br>
Another point to consider is the use of physics to simulate the flightpath and trajectory of objects in mid-air. This can be used in training simulators, for example flight simulators, and it could also potentially be used in sports games to add an element of skill to the game, thus making it more appealing to an audience that enjoys playing sports in real life, as well as those who want to improve their skills by using a video game to gain experience and see what the game is like in a virtual, pressure-less environment. This technology is also already widespread in FPS and TPS games, as a core mechanic of these games is shooting large projectiles or throwing explosives that are all affected by gravity, and as such, have an individually simulated flight path and time dependant on the direction and the strength of the gravitational field, both of which are simulated by functions within the game’s physics engine.  
<br></br>
In conclusion, physics concepts and equations are used throughout most of modern-day video games and will continue to be used to provide the player with a realistic and immersive experience, for example, by including soft-body particle systems and ragdoll physics. Physics can also be incorporated into training programs to make them feel more authentic and could provide valuable experience for real-life scenarios, such as military tank operating simulators which use physics to determine the trajectory of shells fired, as well as the forces acting on the treads and the sides of the tank, leading to a more realistic sense of movement.
